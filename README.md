# hangman
Modification of a terminal hangman file to work on a front end

Current issues:

1 Translate puts messages into something front end can use.
2 I don't know if the guess that shows up at the end of address is a route or how I can be expected to use multiple routes to solve a problem unless it expects me to store the data somehow like in a loop or params[] added variable, that might alter route.
3 Move letter selection to front end.
